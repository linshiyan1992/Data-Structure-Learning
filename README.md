# Data-Structure-Learning
My implemention while learning Data Structure

For Newbie who learn to program : reading book and making notes by hand is important but do remember that Coding in your computer is the essential part of learning.Never give up the problem you met while trying to implement the concept you've learned from the book or class.Fire up your gdb will save you time while
letting you have better understading of low-level /all these subtle flaw mistake,why that happend.

That's why I decide to publish my code to github,It's all implemented in C and not only learning DS,but also learning GNU Make and GDB other stuff etc.
